# LiveFootballWorldCup-java

## Specifications

Make a library that would support processing of live football world cup matches and their scores. It should support starting the match, assuming initial score 0-0 and adding it to the scoreboard. Further it should allow updating of the score for each match based on team names. Besides that, it should allow to get summary of all matches, ordered by their total score. And lastly, it should support finishing the game that is in progress. This will also remove match from the scoreboard.

- Team name is set only at initialization and cannot be changed
- Initial score will be set to 0, but can be later updated
- App is not aware of match or scoreboard history - its previous state
